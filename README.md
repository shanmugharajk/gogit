# Gogit

This project is an implementation of Git internals written in pure Go.

The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of how Git works under the hood by building it from scratch. It also serves as a practical exercise for learning the Go programming language.

## Approach

This implementation is a Go translation of the concepts and code presented in the book '[Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/)' by James Coglan, which originally uses Ruby for its examples.

## Vision

While the initial focus is on building the core internals following the book, the long-term vision for `gogit` is to evolve it into a robust, feature-rich, and idiomatic Go library for Git. The aspiration is for it to become a comprehensive solution for interacting with Git repositories in Go, much like JGit is for the Java ecosystem.
